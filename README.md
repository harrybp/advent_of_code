# Advent of Code 2018
Going for all the stars, have a go yourself [here](https://adventofcode.com/).
- Coded using python3.

## Thoughts
Got stuck a few times, didn't make it to the last day.
I chose python because I thought development time would be low which was true but it made me code some of the exercises in a lazy way. Performance also suffered which came to be an issue in the later days. I think it would be better to choose a language which forces you to think more carefully about your implementation.
